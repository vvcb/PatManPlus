Welcome to the next-generation patient list manager.

This will change the life of every junior doctor in the NHS.

 The software is designed to allow Junior Doctors to manage their patient lists to provide an efficient way to complete a ward round and manage the various jobs assigned to that ward.

In many hospitals there are inefficient methods to control the process utilising several word documents or poorly managed spreadsheets. A system was developed to improve this through the use of an Access DB which has had positive impact on the efficiency of Dr's and Consultants within their own working environment. Together we have analysed this system to produce an MVP that would allow replace it with an application to be run from an .exe file that can be run directly from a hospitals network drive. Thus allowing easy transfer of the system from one hospital to another without the requirement of guidance/training.
